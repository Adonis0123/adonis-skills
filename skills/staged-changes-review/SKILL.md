# Staged Changes Review

Checklist-driven, deterministic review of Git staged changes. Produces reproducible findings by combining grep-based scanning with closed-question semantic analysis.

## 输出要求

**重要：本技能必须使用中文输出所有分析结果和建议。**

- **语言**: 始终使用中文回复
- **编码**: UTF-8
- **风格**: 专业、简洁，发现必须附带代码证据

## Workflow (8 Steps)

Execute steps in strict order: **0 → 0.5 → 1 → 2 → 2.5 → 3 → 4 → 5**. Do not skip or reorder any step.

### Step 0: Collect Changes

```bash
git diff --cached
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached --name-status
```

If no staged changes exist, output "无暂存变更，审查终止。" and stop.

### Step 0.5: Detect Project Profile

Detect the project type **once** to determine which rule categories to activate.

```bash
# Detect framework
python3 -c "
import json, sys
try:
    with open('package.json') as f:
        d = json.load(f)
    deps = {**d.get('dependencies', {}), **d.get('devDependencies', {})}
    if 'next' in deps:
        print('react-nextjs')
    elif 'react' in deps:
        print('react-app')
    else:
        print('generic')
except:
    print('generic')
" 2>/dev/null || echo "generic"

# Count staged file types
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -cE '\.(tsx|jsx)$' || echo 0
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -cE '\.py$' || echo 0
```

Record the detected **profile** — it determines active rule categories:

| Profile | Condition | Active Rule Categories |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **react-nextjs** | `next` in dependencies | SEC + REACT + PERF + ASYNC + STR + LOGIC/BREAK + BIZ + REPO |
| **react-app** | `react` but no `next` | SEC + REACT + ASYNC + STR + LOGIC/BREAK + BIZ + REPO (001-007) |
| **python-generic** | Python files majority, no package.json | SEC + STR + LOGIC/BREAK + BIZ + REPO (001-006) |
| **generic** | No package.json or detection failed | SEC + STR + LOGIC/BREAK + BIZ + REPO (001-006) |

**REACT-\*** and **PERF-\*** rules are **skipped entirely** for `python-generic` or `generic` profiles. **REPO-007** requires react-nextjs or react-app; **REPO-008** requires react-nextjs only. If detection fails, default to `generic`.

### Step 1: Classify Files

Classify every staged file into priority tiers using the rules in `references/review-rules.md` §1.

- Assign each file exactly one priority (P0–P4).
- **Skip P4 files entirely** — do not read or scan them.
- Sort remaining files by priority (P0 first, P3 last).
- Record the file list for the report's "审查范围" section.

### Step 2: Deterministic Scan

For each file (P0 → P3 order), execute **every applicable** deterministic rule from `references/review-rules.md` §2.

**Execution method:**
1. Use grep patterns from `references/language-patterns.md` matching the file's language.
2. Run each grep against the **staged diff** (`git diff --cached -- <file>`) or the file itself.
3. If a pattern matches, record a finding immediately — no subjective filtering.
4. Use the severity from `references/review-rules.md` §4 — do NOT modify severity.

**MANDATORY**: Every rule × file combination must be executed or explicitly marked N/A (wrong file type or inactive profile). Do not skip rules because "they seem unlikely."

### Step 2.5: Impact Scope Analysis

For P0/P1 files, run a one-time impact scope assessment and record results for the "影响范围" section.

```bash
# 1. New/modified exported symbols in staged diff
git diff --cached -U0 -- "*.ts" "*.tsx" | grep -E "^\+export (function|const|class|interface|type)"

# 2. API route changes
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "app/api/|pages/api/"

# 3. Server Action changes (security impact)
git diff --cached -- "*.ts" "*.tsx" | grep -E '^[+-].*("use server"|'"'"'use server'"'"')'

# 4. Environment variable changes
git diff --cached -- ".env*" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "^[+-][A-Z_]+" | head -10
```

For each exported symbol found (up to 5 symbols), check reference count:

```bash
# Replace SYMBOL_NAME with actual symbol
grep -rl "SYMBOL_NAME" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" src/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

If no impact scope items are detected, note "无显著影响范围变更" in the report.

### Step 3: Semantic Review

For each file (P0 → P3 order), answer **every applicable** semantic question from `references/review-rules.md` §3 and §3b.

**Execution method:**
1. Read the file's staged diff and surrounding context (use `Read` tool for full file when needed).
2. For each semantic rule, answer the closed question with exactly one of:
   - **YES** — issue found. MUST provide: file:line + evidence snippet.
   - **NO** — reviewed, no issue found.
   - **N/A** — rule does not apply to this file type or change.
3. Only YES answers produce findings. Use the severity from §4.

**BIZ 规则执行说明:**
1. 对 P1 文件，使用 `git show HEAD:<path>` 获取变更前版本，与暂存版本对比进行 before/after 行为分析。
2. BIZ findings 必须包含"变更前行为"、"变更后行为"和"影响场景"字段。
3. 纯重构（逻辑等价变换）不应报为行为变更。
4. **采样限制**: P1 文件超过 10 个时，BIZ 规则仅分析前 5 个文件，并注明"剩余 N 个文件未进行 BIZ 分析（采样限制）"。

**MANDATORY**: Answer every question. Do not skip questions because context seems insufficient — answer N/A with a brief reason instead.

### Step 4: Merge & Deduplicate

1. Collect all findings from Steps 2 and 3.
2. Generate a fingerprint for each finding: `{ruleId}:{file}:{line}`.
3. Deduplicate by fingerprint — if the same fingerprint appears from both a deterministic and semantic rule, keep the one with higher severity.
4. Group findings by severity: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW.
5. Apply output budget limits from `references/report-template.md` §3.

### Step 5: Generate Report

Output the report using the exact structure from `references/report-template.md` §2.

1. **审查范围**: file counts and rule counts.
2. **影响范围**: impact scope analysis results.
3. **业务影响分析**: BIZ findings 的摘要表格（变更文件 / BIZ 规则 / 行为变更摘要）。若无 BIZ 发现，输出"未检测到用户可感知的业务行为变更"。
4. **发现总览**: severity summary table.
5. **结论**: auto-select from `references/review-rules.md` §5 based on highest severity found.
6. **分级发现**: findings in `references/report-template.md` §1 format, grouped by severity. BIZ findings 按 severity 归入对应级别。
7. **文件审查矩阵**: per-file summary table.

## Execution Constraints (MANDATORY)

These constraints are non-negotiable. Violating any constraint invalidates the review.

1. **No skipping**: Every rule must be evaluated against every applicable file. Document N/A explicitly.
2. **No free-form analysis**: Only report findings that match a defined rule ID. Do not invent new categories.
3. **Forced answers**: Every semantic question must receive YES, NO, or N/A. Leaving a question unanswered is forbidden.
4. **Evidence lock**: Every YES finding must cite a specific file:line and include a code snippet. Findings without evidence are invalid.
5. **Severity is immutable**: Use the severity from the mapping table. Do not upgrade or downgrade based on subjective judgment.
6. **Conclusion is templated**: The conclusion must be one of the four templates in review-rules.md §5. Do not write a custom conclusion.
7. **Fingerprint required**: Every finding must include a fingerprint in `{ruleId}:{file}:{line}` format.

## Context Budget Strategy

When staged changes are large (>500 lines or >15 files):

- **P0 files**: Always read full content — security-critical.
- **P1 files**: Read full diff. If a single file diff >200 lines, focus on: function signatures, exported symbols, error handling blocks, and security-sensitive patterns.
- **P2 files**: Read diff only. Focus on SEC rules and BREAK-003/BREAK-004.
- **P3 files**: Scan diff headers only. Apply STR rules only.
- If total context would exceed capacity, process files strictly by priority and stop at capacity with a note: "剩余 N 个低优先级文件未审查".

**REACT/ASYNC rule sampling limit**: For rules that require Read tool for semantic verification (REACT-001, REACT-003, ASYNC-001, ASYNC-002), if grep returns more than 5 matches, take the **first 5 matches only** and note "N 处未验证（采样限制）". This prevents excessive Read tool calls.

## Validator Interface Contract

This skill's output is consumed by `staged-review-validator`. The following fields are required for compatibility:

- Finding title must include `[ruleId]` prefix (e.g., `[SEC-003] SQL 拼接风险`)
- Each finding must include a `指纹` (Fingerprint) field
- Severity uses 4 levels: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Report structure follows `references/report-template.md` §2
- `BIZ-*` findings 使用 before/after 格式（含"变更前行为"、"变更后行为"、"影响场景"字段），详见 `references/report-template.md` §1
